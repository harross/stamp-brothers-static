# Stamp Brothers - The Website

A basic, static, mobile first website built with tailwindcss built as a learning experience.

I built this site with Tailwind + HTML for a business, and it is in use as a live production site, successfully garnering contracts & business. 
It is great to see my first attempt have some success.

My other Tailwind websites will continue to be added as I build them, which I hope will be more often.
